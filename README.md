# sinfinamente
Assignment 1. "sin fina mente" for my Comm Lab class, 2021, NYUAD.

        ·Project name: 
“sin fina mente”

        ·Project Description: 

-This is a project that was created at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. This was my first time building a setup for a short film, aiming to create a video with visually pleasing aesthetics which frames could work as photographs. My main reference for this project was Bill Viola, whose installation art inspired me to start this project and use water for the concept of my project.

-This project belongs to a series of self-portraits that I’ve been creating since 2019. The theme of this work is the identity, being a reflection of my artistic expression and portraying my inner self from my perspective.

-The concept of this project is a metaphor for my life during the start of the pandemic. It  forced me to get along with myself and go back to that self-centered state of mind. Some days, I felt like all my life was being repetitive and I called into question for the second time the meaning of my existence. By talking with my friends and beloved ones, I realized that I was not the only one passing through this, but I still wanted to be by myself. I put a mask on because I was ashamed of feeling this way while the entire world was in chaos and there were bigger concerns than mine. On my cell phone notes I wrote: "The lockdown made me feel like I was living an apocalyptic version of Big Brother, not being allowed to leave my house and being observed all the time through web cameras, Zoom, social media, and by my family. I realized that the only place where I can always enjoy a complete absence of looks is my bathroom. So, I think this will be my happy shelter now."

-As I mentioned before, the aesthetics of this project is really important to me, so I considered it important to create a minimalistic website so the audience focuses on the short film.

        ·Process:

-For the filming, I struggled while implementing the concept because the quarantine forced me to work with limited resources and without any help. I was improvising while creating the set-up: all the elements are common stuff that we can find in our house.

-My lack of skills made me struggle with the coding of the website. The fonctions are really simple, using mostly HTML text formatting and CSS to place and resize the texts. All of the images are used as backgrounds, which I had to create and edit on a rater graphics editor.
 
        ·Reflection/Evaluation: 

-I don’t know how my project would have looked like if I could have worked with more material. However, all the problems and limitations that I had to overcome made me feel more proud of the final result.

-For the website, I think that the features are really simple and I could still work on them so it doesn’t look amateur, but it does direct the attention to the aesthetics so I’m content with the result.
